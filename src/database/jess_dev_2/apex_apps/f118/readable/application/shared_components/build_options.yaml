      Differentiate between events that can be viewed by the public (external) and those that can only be viewed by those entered into the Access Control List (internal).
      This option requires the Access Control Scope to be set to 'Reader access for any authenticated user'. By populating the Contact Email on events with the relevant addresses from users listed in the Access Control List, the Contact can be used to search for events specifically for that person.
